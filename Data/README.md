## Supplementary Data, etc
This directory contains multiple supplementary 'odds and ends', including sample metadata, multiple sequence alignments, treefiles, and pFst outliers. These are described below

#### 1) WG-Seq_Samps_wMetaData_FINAL-SAMPS.xlsx
- Pertinent sample metadata. 
#### 2) Final-Concatenated-Sequences.fa
- Concatenated sequence data (fasta file) for our final set of clock-like genes. Used for all downstream phylogenetic inference/phylodynamic analysis.
#### 3) Final-Clock-Genes-Concat-IQTree.tree
- ML tree inferred by IQtree, using the concatenated clock-like genes. 
#### 4) Top-0.1-pFst-All-Annotated.tsv
- The top pFst outliers that distinguished tumor transmission clusters, annotated for gene ID.
